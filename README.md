**Social Media Analysis - User Engagement & Behavioral Insights (SQL Project)**


**Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing social media user activity using SQL queries. It examines user engagement behavior across posts, likes, comments, and hashtags. The goal is to uncover patterns in user interaction, identify top contributors, and provide insights that can help in shaping marketing, content, and engagement strategies.
Objective
â€¢	To clean and validate data by checking for duplicates and null values.
â€¢	To segment users based on activity levels (likes, comments, posts).
â€¢	To calculate engagement rates and identify top-performing users.
â€¢	To analyze hashtags and content themes driving the highest engagement.
â€¢	To recommend actionable strategies for increasing user retention and overall engagement.


**Key Focus Areas**

â€¢	Data Quality Checks â€“ Removing duplicate and null entries from user, photo, tag, and engagement tables.
â€¢	User Activity Segmentation â€“ Categorizing users into low, medium, and high engagement groups.
â€¢	Engagement Analysis â€“ Measuring likes, comments, and photos to evaluate user behavior.
â€¢	Top Users & Influencers â€“ Identifying users with the highest engagement rates and loyalty.
â€¢	Content & Hashtag Insights â€“ Determining which tags and themes generate maximum interaction.
â€¢	Inactive User Behavior â€“ Spotting users with zero activity and planning re-engagement strategies.
â€¢	Time-Based Trends â€“ Understanding when users are most active to optimize posting schedules.


**Strategic Recommendations**

â€¢	Leverage Top Users: Collaborate with highly engaged users for influencer campaigns and brand promotions.
â€¢	Boost Mid-Tier Engagement: Provide visibility, rewards, or challenges to help mid-level users reach higher activity levels.
â€¢	Re-Engage Inactive Users: Use personalized notifications, gamification, and onboarding nudges to activate dormant accounts.
â€¢	Content Strategy: Focus on hashtags like #delicious, #beauty, #foodie which show the highest engagement.
â€¢	Optimal Posting Time: Schedule content for evenings and weekends, when user engagement peaks.
â€¢	Targeted Campaigns: Segment users (low, mid, high engagement) and tailor marketing efforts accordingly.
â€¢	Continuous Monitoring: Track engagement rates and hashtag performance regularly to refine strategies.


**Conclusion**

The analysis highlights that a small set of highly active users and specific hashtags drive the majority of engagement on the platform. Maintaining data quality, segmenting users effectively, and aligning content with trending themes are crucial for boosting overall interaction. By recognizing top contributors, incentivizing mid-tier users, and reactivating inactive ones, the platform can achieve sustainable growth, improved retention, and stronger community engagement.
